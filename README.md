weiboBot
========

Just for fun and test.  weiboBot is something that uses sina weibo as Controler and Command server, receive instructions from weibo and excecute them.


To build this bot, we need to reverse the login process for sina weibo and use python codes to emulate the whole process as what we have done in the code.

But in actuality, we can also adopt other ways to solve the login problem, which need import Splinter and set up phantomjs engine, which can allow us to emulate browser's behaviour using python.
